By the sun and its brightness.
And the moon as it follows it.
And the day as it reveals it.
And the night as it conceals it.
And the sky, and He who built it.
And the earth, and He who spread it.
And the soul, and He who formed it.
And inspired it with its wickedness and its righteousness.
Successful is he who purifies it.
And failing is he who corrupts it.
Thamood denied in its rebelliousness.
When it followed its most wretched.
The messenger of God said to them, “This is God’s she-camel, so let her drink.”
But they denied him, then hamstrung her. So their Lord crushed them for their crime, and He leveled it.
And He has no fear of its consequences.
