When the sky breaks apart.
When the planets are scattered.
When the oceans are exploded.
When the tombs are tossed around.
Every soul will know what it has advanced, and what it has deferred.
O man! What deluded you concerning your Lord, the Most Generous?
He Who created you, and formed you, and proportioned you.
In whatever form He willed, He assembled you.
But you reject the religion.
Although over you are watchers.
Honest recorders.
They know everything you do.
The pious will be in bliss.
While the wicked will be in Hell.
They will roast in it on the Day of Justice.
And they will have no escape from it.
What will make you realize what the Day of Justice is?
Then again, what will make you realize what the Day of Justice is?
The Day when no soul will avail another soul whatsoever—and all authority on that Day is God’s.
